* Optional Notification for Sync, so you could get notified after the Sync
* Optionally Search in Password Fields
* Since this new App is based on 7Pass, it gets the Base of the old Layout and Design, but really all Screens are now updated and overhauled to gain a easier access to all the old and new functions of the App

* Timestamp of the Actual DB on every Page
